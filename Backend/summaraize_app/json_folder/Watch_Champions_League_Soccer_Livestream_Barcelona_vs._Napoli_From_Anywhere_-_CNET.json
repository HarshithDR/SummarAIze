Reviews ethics statement\nThe Catalan giants take on the Neapolitans after the two sides played out a 1-1 draw last month.\nBarcelona host Napoli in this finely poised Champions League last-16, second-leg clash at the Lluís Companys Olympic Stadium.\nLast month's first leg at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona saw Victor Osimhen salvage a draw for Napoli. It was the Nigerian striker's first appearance since December, with his 75th-minute goal canceling out Robert Lewandowski's 60th-minute opener for Barca.\nNapoli have never beaten Barcelona in a competitive fixture, but with star man Osimhen back fit, the Italian side will be confident of pulling off a memorable win here and advancing to the quarterfinals.\nBelow, we'll outline the best live TV streaming services for watching every game wherever you are in the world.\nRobert Lewandowski handed Barca the lead in the 60th minute with a smart finish in the first leg in Italy.\nBarcelona play Napoli at the Lluís Companys Olympic Stadium, on Tuesday, March 12. Kickoff is set for 9 p.m. CET local time in Spain, which is 4 p.m. ET or 1 p.m. PT in the US and Canada, 8 p.m. GMT in the UK and 7 a.m. AEDT on Wednesday, March 13, in Australia.\nIf you're unable to view Champions League matches locally, you may need a different way to watch the action; that's where using a VPN can come in handy. A VPN can stop your ISP from throttling your speeds on game day by encrypting your traffic, and it's also a great idea if you want an extra layer of privacy for your devices and log-ins while traveling and using various Wi-Fi networks.\nWith a VPN, you're able to virtually change your location on your phone, tablet or laptop to access the game. If your internet provider or mobile carrier assigns an IP address that incorrectly shows your location in a blackout zone, a VPN can fix that problem by giving you an IP address in your correct, non-blackout area. Most VPNs, like our Editors' Choice, ExpressVPN, make it really easy to do this.\nUsing a VPN to watch or stream sports is legal in any country where VPNs are legal, including the US, UK and Canada, as long as you have a legitimate subscription to the service you're streaming. Be sure your VPN is set up correctly to prevent leaks: Even where VPNs are legal, the streaming service may terminate the account of anyone it suspects is circumventing correctly applied blackout restrictions.\nLooking for other options? Be sure to check out some of the great VPN deals taking place right now.\nExpressVPN is our current best VPN pick for people who want a reliable and safe VPN, and it works on a variety of devices. It's normally $13 a month, and you can sign up for ExpressVPN and save 35% -- the equivalent of $8.32 a month -- if you get an annual subscription.\nNote that ExpressVPN offers a 30-day money-back guarantee.\nAmerican soccer fans can stream this season's tournament via Paramount Plus, which has exclusive live English-language broadcast rights in the US for UEFA Champions League matches.\nParamount Plus has two main subscription plans in the US: Essential for $6 a month and Premium for $12 a month.   Both offer coverage of the Champions League.\nThe cheaper Essential option has ads for on-demand streaming. It also lacks live CBS feeds and the ability to download shows to watch offline later. Newcomers can take advantage of a 30-day free trial, while students may qualify for a 25% discount. Black Friday savings are also still available, though we don't know how long for.\nRead our Paramount Plus review.\nTNT Sports has Champions League live broadcast rights in the UK.\nFormerly BT Sport, TNT Sports is offering Champions League matches exclusively live this season to viewers in the UK. You can access TNT Sports in the same way as its predecessor, including via Sky Q as a TV package, as well as by streaming online. It costs £30 either way and comes in a package that includes Discovery Plus' library of documentary content.\nIf you want to stream UCL games live in Canada, subscribe to DAZN Canada. The service has exclusive broadcast rights to the Champions League this season.\nA DAZN subscription costs CA$30 a month or CA$200 a year. It will also give you access to Europa League and EFL Championship soccer, Six Nations rugby and WTA tennis.\nAs well as dedicated apps for iOS and Android, there's a wide range of support for set-top boxes and smart TVs.\nFootball fans Down Under can watch UCL matches on streaming service Stan Sport, which has exclusive rights to show the Champions League live in Australia this season.\nStan Sport will set you back AU$10 a month (on top of a AU$10 Stan subscription), but the streaming service is currently offering a seven-day free trial.\nA subscription will also give you access to Europa League and Europa Conference League action, as well as international rugby and Formula E."
