Reviews ethics statement\nIt's a potential title decider at the Etihad Stadium.\nPep Guardiola will be pitting his wits against his former apprentice Mikel Arteta on Saturday in what could looks set to be crucial title race match up between Arsenal and Man City.\nThe Gunners went into the international break at the Summit of the EPL and are on a run of eight straight wins, the most recent victory coming against Brentford thanks to a late Kai Havertz strike.\nMan City, meanwhile, remain on course for an historic \"double treble,\" with Guardiola's men still in the FA Cup and Champions League as well as being in the mix for a fourth successive EPL title.\nBelow, we'll outline the best live TV streaming services to use to watch the game live wherever you are in the world.\nKai Havertz of Arsenal celebrates scoring his side's fourth goal during the Premier League match between Sheffield United and Arsenal FC at Bramall Lane on March 4 in Sheffield, England.\nManchester City host Arsenal at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, March 31. Kickoff is set for 4:30 p.m. GMT, which is 11:30 a.m. ET or 8:30 a.m. PT in the US and Canada, and 2:30 a.m. AEDT on Monday, April 1, in Australia.\nIf you find yourself unable to view the game locally, you may need a different way to watch the game -- that's where using a VPN can come in handy. A VPN is also the best way to stop your ISP from throttling your speeds on game day by encrypting your traffic, and it's also a great idea if you're traveling and find yourself connected to a Wi-Fi network, and you want to add an extra layer of privacy for your devices and logins.\nWith a VPN, you're able to virtually change your location on your phone, tablet or laptop to get access to the game. So if your internet provider or mobile carrier has stuck you with an IP address that incorrectly shows your location in a blackout zone, a VPN can correct that problem by giving you an IP address in your correct, non-blackout area. Most VPNs, like our Editors' Choice, ExpressVPN, make it really easy to do this.\nUsing a VPN to watch or stream sports is legal in any country where VPNs are legal, including the US, UK and Canada, as long as you have a legitimate subscription to the service you're streaming. You should be sure your VPN is set up correctly to prevent leaks: Even where VPNs are legal, the streaming service may terminate the account of anyone it deems to be circumventing correctly applied blackout restrictions.\nLooking for other options? Be sure to check out some of the other great VPN deals taking place right now.\nExpressVPN is our current best VPN pick for people who want a reliable and safe VPN, and it works on a variety of devices. It's normally $13 a month, and you can sign up for ExpressVPN and save 35% -- the equivalent of $8.32 a month -- if you get an annual subscription.\nNote that ExpressVPN offers a 30-day money-back guarantee.\nSunday's Man City vs. Arsenal match is streaming on Peacock.

You'll need to have a Peacock Premium or Premium Plus account to stream games live, which costs $6 a month or $60 per year.\nPremier League rights in the UK are split between Sky Sports, Amazon Prime Video and TNT Sports (previously known as BT Sport).
