Reviews ethics statement\nSpurs look to bounce back from damaging defeat to Fulham as they head to Kenilworth Road.\nTottenham will be hoping to move back into the Premier League's top four on Saturday as they seek a win against relegation battlers Luton Town.\nSpurs boss Ange Postecoglou will have had international week to ruminate over his side's dismal derby defeat to Fulham before the break -- a loss that allowed Aston Villa to open up a 2-point gap between them in fourth spot.\nDespite a string of brave performances, Luton have failed to gain a win from their last five EPL fixtures, and only remain outside the relegation zone on account of Nottingham Forest's recent 4-point penalty for breaching Profit and Sustainability rules.\nBelow, we'll outline the best live TV streaming services to use to watch the game live wherever you are in the world.\nLuke Berry scored his first ever Premier League goal to salvage a dramatic point for Luton in their draw with Nottingham Forest last time out.\nSpurs host Luton at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Saturday, March 30. Kickoff is set for 3 p.m. GMT (11 a.m. ET, 8 a.m. PT in the US and Canada; and 2 a.m. AEDT on Sunday, March 31, in Australia).\nIf you find yourself unable to view the game locally, you may need a different way to watch the game -- that's where using a VPN can come in handy. A VPN is also the best way to stop your ISP from throttling your speeds on game day by encrypting your traffic, and it's also a great idea if you're traveling and find yourself connected to a Wi-Fi network, and you want to add an extra layer of privacy for your devices and logins.\nWith a VPN, you're able to virtually change your location on your phone, tablet or laptop to get access to the game. So if your internet provider or mobile carrier has stuck you with an IP address that incorrectly shows your location in a blackout zone, a VPN can correct that problem by giving you an IP address in your correct, non-blackout area. Most VPNs, like our Editors' Choice, ExpressVPN, make it really easy to do this.\nUsing a VPN to watch or stream sports is legal in any country where VPNs are legal, including the US, UK and Canada, as long as you have a legitimate subscription to the service you're streaming. You should be sure your VPN is set up correctly to prevent leaks: Even where VPNs are legal, the streaming service may terminate the account of anyone it deems to be circumventing correctly applied blackout restrictions.\nLooking for other options? Be sure to check out some of the other great VPN deals taking place right now.\nExpressVPN is our current best VPN pick for people who want a reliable and safe VPN, and it works on a variety of devices. It's normally $13 a month, and you can sign up for ExpressVPN and save 35% -- the equivalent of $8.32 a month -- if you get an annual subscription.\nNote that ExpressVPN offers a 30-day money-back guarantee.\nSaturday's Tottenham vs. Luton match is streaming on Peacock. You'll need a Peacock Premium or Premium Plus account to catch the game live.\nNBC's streaming service, Peacock, offers access to all the matches of this season's Premier League that aren't shown on cable. You'll need to have a Peacock Premium or Premium Plus account to stream games live, which costs $6 a month or $60 per year.\nNo broadcaster has the rights to show this game live in the UK, due to the traditional Saturday 3 p.m. kickoff blackout, which prohibits matches being shown in the region at that time in order to protect attendances throughout the English football pyramid.\nThat also means that if you're in the UK traveling for pleasure or for work, you're unlikely to be able to watch the game like you normally would at home, thanks to geo-blocking.\nThere is one option to get around this, however. By using a VPN, as explained above, you can set your location to a country where the match is being broadcast and go from there.\nIf you want to stream Tottenham vs. Luton live in Canada, you'll need to subscribe to Fubo. The service has exclusive rights for this Premier League season.\nFubo is the go-to destination for Canadians looking to watch the EPL this season with exclusive streaming rights to every game. It costs CA$25 per month, though you can save some cash by paying quarterly or annually.\nFootball fans Down Under can watch this EPL fixture on streaming service Optus Sport, which is showing every single Premier League game live in Australia this season.\nWith exclusive rights to screen every EPL match live this season, as well as German Bundesliga and Spanish La Liga games, streaming service Optus Sport is a particularly big draw for Aussie soccer fans.\nIf you're already an Optus network customer you can bag Optus Sport for a reduced price, with discounts bringing the price down to as low as AU$7 per month. If you're not, a standalone monthly subscription to the service starts at AU$25."
