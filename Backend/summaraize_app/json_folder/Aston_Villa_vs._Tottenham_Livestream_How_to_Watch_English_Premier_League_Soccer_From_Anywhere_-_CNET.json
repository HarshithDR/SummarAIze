Reviews ethics statement\nIt's a potentially pivotal fixture in the battle for the top four.\nTottenham travel to fourth-placed Aston Villa on Sunday, knowing that a win will pull them to within 2 points of their opponents in the English Premier League table.\nSpurs had to come from behind with three late goals to seal a 3-1 comeback victory over Crystal Palace last weekend, in a match that saw Timo Werner score his first goal for the club.\nVilla, meanwhile, edged past Luton with a 3-2 win over the Hatters last Saturday, before drawing 0-0 in midweek against Dutch giants Ajax in the Europa Conference League.\nSpurs will be without Richarlison thanks to a knee issue for this match, while Jacob Ramsey faces a late fitness test for Villa.\nBelow, we'll outline the best live TV streaming services to use to watch the game live wherever you are in the world.\nOllie Watkins has been involved in 26 Premier League goals this season, the most of any player in the EPL.\nAston Villa host Spurs at Villa Park in Birmingham on Sunday, March 10. Kickoff is set for 1 p.m. GMT, which is 9 a.m. ET or 6 a.m. PT in the US and Canada, and 12 a.m. AEDT on Monday, March 11, in Australia.\nIf you find yourself unable to view the game locally, you may need a different way to watch the game -- that's where using a VPN can come in handy. A VPN is also the best way to stop your ISP from throttling your speeds on game day by encrypting your traffic, and it's also a great idea if you're traveling and find yourself connected to a Wi-Fi network, and you want to add an extra layer of privacy for your devices and logins.\nWith a VPN, you're able to virtually change your location on your phone, tablet or laptop to get access to the game. So if your internet provider or mobile carrier has stuck you with an IP address that incorrectly shows your location in a blackout zone, a VPN can correct that problem by giving you an IP address in your correct, non-blackout area. Most VPNs, like our Editors' Choice, ExpressVPN, make it really easy to do this.\nUsing a VPN to watch or stream sports is legal in any country where VPNs are legal, including the US, UK and Canada, as long as you have a legitimate subscription to the service you're streaming. You should be sure your VPN is set up correctly to prevent leaks: Even where VPNs are legal, the streaming service may terminate the account of anyone it deems to be circumventing correctly applied blackout restrictions.\nLooking for other options? Be sure to check out some of the other great VPN deals taking place right now.\nExpressVPN is our current best VPN pick for people who want a reliable and safe VPN, and it works on a variety of devices. It's normally $13 a month, and you can sign up for ExpressVPN and save 35% -- the equivalent of $8.32 a month -- if you get an annual subscription.\nNote that ExpressVPN offers a 30-day money-back guarantee.\nSunday's Aston Villa vs. Tottenham match is streaming on USA Network, which you can access as part of your cable package or at the NBC Sports website with a valid login, and can be streamed via Sling TV and other more expensive streaming TV services.\nSling TV's Blue plan includes USA Network, making it a great option for those wanting to watch Premier League action.
